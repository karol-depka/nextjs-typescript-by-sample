# nextjs-typescript-by-sample
Set of guided samples about how to get started with nextjs + TypeScript.

# About the example application

We have developed a simple web application that displays a list of github users (fetch from github rest api), and when you click on a given user it navigate to a detail page where you can find detailed information about the selected user.

Topics covered in this sample:

- Building a hello wolrd nextjs app.
- Adding typescript support.
- Adding navigation between pages.
- Fetching data from a remote api (cors enabled).
- Navigating to other pages passing parameters via query string.
- Creating clean urls (seo friendly).
- CSS Styling: Thanks to [arp82](https://github.com/arp82) for this great contribution.

Topics that will be covered in future examples:

- Debugging.
- Deploying.
- Redux support.
